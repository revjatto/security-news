Suppose you want to remove a 'comments' table from a blog application. You can do so by performing the following tasks from the command line (e.g., Terminal).

Step one:

$ rails console 
Step two:

$ ActiveRecord::Migration.drop_table(:comments)
Step three:

$ rake db:migrate
Go check your schema.rb to see that the table was removed.
